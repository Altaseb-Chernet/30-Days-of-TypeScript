# 📘 Day 28 – Advanced Design Patterns in TypeScript


# 1️⃣ What Are Design Patterns?

Design patterns are:

> Reusable solutions to common software design problems.

They help:

* Improve scalability
* Reduce code duplication
* Improve readability
* Make architecture predictable
* Improve testability

---

# 2️⃣ Creational Patterns

These deal with object creation.

---

## 🔹 Singleton Pattern

Ensures only one instance exists.

Used for:

* Logger
* Database connection
* Global configuration
* Cache manager

---

## 🔹 Factory Pattern

Creates objects without exposing creation logic.

Used for:

* API clients
* Payment processors
* Theme generators

---

# 3️⃣ Structural Patterns

These deal with how classes and objects are composed.

---

## 🔹 Adapter Pattern

Converts one interface into another.

Used when:

* Integrating third-party libraries
* Migrating APIs
* Supporting legacy systems

---

## 🔹 Decorator Pattern

Adds functionality dynamically.

Used for:

* Logging
* Validation
* Caching
* Authorization

---

# 4️⃣ Behavioral Patterns

These define how objects communicate.

---

## 🔹 Observer Pattern

Used in:

* Event systems
* State managers
* Pub/Sub architecture

---

## 🔹 Strategy Pattern

Encapsulates interchangeable algorithms.

Used for:

* Payment methods
* Sorting algorithms
* Discount logic


# 🧠 Why These Patterns Matter in TypeScript

TypeScript gives us:

✔ Strong interfaces
✔ Type-safe factories
✔ Discriminated unions
✔ Decorators
✔ Generic pattern flexibility

We can build patterns cleaner than classic OOP languages.
